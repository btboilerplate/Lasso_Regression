## 📌 Project Overview

Lasso Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm that extends linear regression by applying L1 regularization, which helps reduce overfitting and perform feature selection.

In this project:
- A housing dataset is used
- Data is cleaned and analyzed
- A Lasso Regression model is trained
- Predictions are made based on input features
- Model performance is evaluated
- The impact of regularization is analyzed
